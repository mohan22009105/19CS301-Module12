# Ex.No 12.a Stack Using Linked List in Python

This project demonstrates a basic stack implementation in Python using list methods to Stack Operations: Insertion, Deletion, and Displaying Remaining Elements

## AIM

To perform basic stack operations by inserting three elements, deleting one element, and displaying the number of elements remaining in the stack.
## ALGORITHM

1.Start
2.Initialize an empty stack.
3.Push three elements onto the stack.
   Push Element 1
   Push Element 2
   Push Element 3
4.Pop (delete) the top element from the stack.
5.Count the number of elements remaining in the stack.
6.Display the number of remaining elements.
7.End

## PROGRAM


```
stack = []

stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')

print('Initial stack')
print(stack)
print("\nElements popped from stack:")
print(stack.pop())



print('\nStack after elements are popped:')
print(stack)
```
