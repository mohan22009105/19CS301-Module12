## QUEUE USING LINKED LIST-1

### AIM

To write and display all the elements inserted and also display after deleting the first element. 

### ALORITHM 

1. Start the program.

2. Initialize an empty list queue.

3. Insert elements 'a', 'b', and 'c' into the queue using append().

4. Print the queue after insertion.

5. Remove and print the first element from the queue using pop(0) (FIFO behavior).

6. Print the queue after the first element is deleted.

7. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
queue = []
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
print('Queue after elements are inserted: ')
print(queue)
print('Deleting the first element inserted:')
print(queue.pop(0))
print('Queue after the first elements is deleted: ')
print(queue)
```
